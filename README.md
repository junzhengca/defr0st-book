# defr0st

## whoami

I am `defr0st`. Professionally I am a software engineer, but I love hacking and penetration testing.

I regularly post new contents here as I discover new bugs and vulnerabilities from real-world applications and CTFs. Maybe in the future I would also post vulnerability disclosures.
